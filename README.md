**DB_USED**:  **sqlite**

Reason for using **Sqlite**, My Mac recently got updated and MySQL's old version is not compatible, I will have to reinstall it but I don't want to lose out on my old project data, Given the Time constraints I went ahead with SQLite as it is lightweight.

Changing to **MySQL** is a simple change in configuration and I guess I can do it if you are not satisfied with the SQLITE, let me know.

**Changes needed to Migrate to Mysql from SQLite:**
update the adapter in **config/database.yml** to **adapter: mysql2**

and add **bin/bundle add mysql2**
